### Persistence
- Cache
  - [NSURLCache](https://nshipster.com/nsurlcache/)

### Swift
- [Quizz](https://jasper-foe-e81.notion.site/F-L-A-S-H-C-A-R-D-S-592bc284ccce4b3991aa8044705bf573): to review
- [autoclosure](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/articles/using-autoclosure-when-designing-swift-apis/)
- [frozen enum](https://useyourloaf.com/blog/swift-5-frozen-enums/)
- `static func` vs `class func`: static and class both associate a method with a class, rather than an instance of a class. The difference is that subclasses can override class methods; they cannot override static methods.

### Test
- How to call a set up method only once before running all tests? use `override class func setUp()`

### SwiftUI

## CI/CD

### Pipeline
- [How does XCode generate a DerivedData hash?](https://github.com/chipbk10/IOSSwiftBestPractice/blob/main/IOSSwiftBestPractice/CICD/GenerateDerivedDataHash.swift)
- SwiftLint? What is the advantage of create a separate target for SwiftLint? for standardization, and also because you don't want to run swiftlint everytime you build your target (you only need to run it at some point, as a check, but not everytime, especially on the CI, that's too expensive)
- What is the aggregate target used for?
- Sonarqube?
- Keychain doesn't allow to use different accounts to access the same base url (like www.example.com, www.example.com/home, www.example.com/category, etc.) How do we overcome it? The answer is use a custom credential provider (in keychain). It's a bit more subtle than that, like, you can configure keychain to hold different credentials for full repo url-s, but we need an intermediate thing (like dev.azure.com/<organization>). The default macos keychain handler allows only base url (dev.azure.com), or full repo-url (dev.azure.com/../../../<reponame>), but no intermediate ...and it has other disadvantages too
